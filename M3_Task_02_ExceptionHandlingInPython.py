# Exception Handling
'''
#Exception,Error,Compilation Issues
1. Compilation Issues:
   -Syntax Issues, or issues in the code.
   catch by the python compiler
   pritn("kjskjfkd")
2. Exceptions:
    -Issues in your code,catch by PVM [Python Virtual Machine]
    -Run time issues, Handle [PVM]
    a=10
    b=0
    print(a/b)
    -Handling is possible by using try and except
    -Exceptions are always handled by the programmer
3. Errors:
   -Can not be handled by the programmer
   -happen at run time
   -Even PVM can not catch them
   Memory full, Stack overflow, power failure etc.
   -System Design should be robust and Efficient
